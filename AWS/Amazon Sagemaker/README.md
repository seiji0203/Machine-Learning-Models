To classify the Iris dataset using AWS SageMaker, you can follow these steps. SageMaker is a managed service for machine learning that provides a complete environment for building, training, and deploying machine learning models.

Import necessary libraries and set up your SageMaker environment:

Make sure you have the AWS SDK (boto3) installed and your AWS credentials properly configured.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import boto3
import sagemaker
from sagemaker import get_execution_role
from sagemaker.sklearn import SKLearn
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
Load and preprocess the Iris dataset:
```

Load the Iris dataset and split it into training and testing sets:

```python
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

Create and train a machine learning model:
Create and train a machine learning model on the training data. In this example, we're using a Random Forest classifier.

```python
classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
Evaluate the model:
```

Use the test data to evaluate the model's accuracy:

```python
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
Export the model using SageMaker:
```

Now, you can export this model to SageMaker for deployment:

```python
sklearn_model = SKLearn(
    entry_point="script.py",  # Path to your script
    source_dir="source",  # Path to your source code directory
    role=get_execution_role(),
    framework_version="0.23-1",
    sagemaker_session=sagemaker.Session(),
)

sklearn_model.fit({"train": "s3://your-bucket/train-data"})
```

Replace "script.py" with the path to your script and "source" with the path to your source code directory. "s3://your-bucket/train-data" should point to the location of your training data on S3.

Deploy the model:

Deploy the model as an endpoint in SageMaker:

```python
predictor = sklearn_model.deploy(instance_type="ml.m4.xlarge", endpoint_name="iris-classifier")
```
You can specify the instance type as needed for your workload.

Use the deployed model for inference:

You can now use the endpoint for real-time inference on new data. You can use the SageMaker SDK or AWS SDK (boto3) to make predictions.

Remember to replace the placeholders with your specific values and paths. This example outlines the general workflow for classifying the Iris dataset in SageMaker.
